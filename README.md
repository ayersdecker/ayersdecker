## OpenWeatherLite
A simple weather application that will retrieve the current weather conditions closest to the user. This application communicates with stations located across the United States free of charge. The application has only been tested on Android at the moment, but future support for iOS is coming July 2023. 

```For Developers:``` If you want to use the code from this application, I encourage you to check out the OpenWeatherLite-Nuget Repository. This is optimized for use in C# but can be relativily understood for other languages too!

Technologies used Within: OpenWeather API, Android Device API
